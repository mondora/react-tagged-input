```

### Usage

To make give this component a proper look and feel, you will want to include the [these styles](https://github.com/tutorialhorizon/react-tagged-input/blob/master/css/react-tagged-input.css) and namespace them appropriately using the `classes` property as shown below to customize them as per your liking.

Space and comma act as the default delimiters for when the user types.  Customise this with the `delimiters` 
prop, which should be set to an array of 1 character strings.

```js
var React = require('react'),
  TaggedInput = require('react-tagged-input'),
  mountPoint = document.querySelector('body');

React.render(
  <TaggedInput
    autofocus={true} // Gives the component focus after it mounts
    backspaceDeletesWord={true} // false deletes one character at a time
    placeholder={'Your favorite npm modules'}
    tags={['javascript', 'react']} // pre-assigned tags
    onEnter={/*function*/}
    onAddTag={/*function*/} // argument - tag that was added
    onRemoveTag={/*function*/} // argument - tag that got removed
    tagOnBlur={false}          // If true, creates a tag from any text entered when input box loses focus
    unique={true} // Whether duplicate entries are allowed
    classes={'my-css-namespace'}
    removeTagLabel={"\u274C"} // Unicode of a symbol or an Object click to delete tags. Defaults to 'x'
    disabled={true} // Disables tags deletion or insertion
  />,
  mountPoint );
```
